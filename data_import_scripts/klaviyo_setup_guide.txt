Import Email List into Klaviyo

To import an email list into Klaviyo, you can use the Klaviyo API to programmatically add each email address to your Klaviyo account. Here is a code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to import an email list into Klaviyo:

Make sure to replace "YOUR\_API\_KEY" with your actual Klaviyo API key and "YOUR\_LIST\_ID" with the ID of the list where you want to import the emails. Also, update the emails list with the actual email addresses you want to import.

This code snippet uses the requests library to make an HTTP POST request to the Klaviyo API endpoint for adding members to a list. The email addresses are provided in the request payload as a list of profiles. The response from the API is checked for the status code to determine if the import was successful.

Please note that this code snippet assumes you have already set up the necessary API key and permissions in your Klaviyo account.
